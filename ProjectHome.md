## Overview ##
Gollum is a framework for creating map visualizations using GWT (Google Web Toolkit). It uses OpenLayers underneath as its map display.


Gollum comes with easy-to-use map layers (vector layers, image layers, marker layers, etc.) that can be easily called using Java instead of the OpenLayers API in Javascript. It also provides an area to put your custom controls for your application.

## Usage ##
To begin using Gollum, just add the following to your GWT project's module xml file:

`<inherits name='org.krayne.gollum.Gollum'/>`

See [Tutorial](Tutorial.md) for more information.
